# iNoteBook-MERN-Stack-Project
 ### iNoteBook is a simple and easy-to-use notes app created using MERN stack
As a starting point for learning the MERN stack, I built a web app named iNoteBook. iNoteBook is a simple note-taking app that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. Users can also create an account and log in to access their notes.

I built iNoteBook to learn more about React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am proud of how the app turned out, and I believe it is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to keep track of their thoughts and ideas.

Here I have attached a short video which demonstartes the iNoteBook App.
